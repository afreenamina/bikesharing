## Results:

### User Type

From the chart, it is clear that the people who use bikes sharing services are the subscribers and the single-use customers are mostly tourists.

Compared to NYC, there will be fewer tourists in Des Moines, so we need to attract more local people to use our bike sharing in a regular basis by offering -

* Single Use - Pay as you go

* Subscribers -
    * Annual or Monthly membership.
    * Discount for Students.
    * Discount for low-income communities.

* Morning 8 AM - 9 AM 
* Evening 5 PM - 6 PM
